2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
BUFC-1#1 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer IBUF has no loads. An input buffer must drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.
Related violations: <none>

RTSTAT-10#1 Warning
No routable loads  
25 net(s) have no routable loads. The first 15 problem net(s) are ip_car_i/centre_1_key_state[4], ip_car_i/centre_1_key_state[5], ip_car_i/centre_1_key_state[7], ip_car_i/centre_1/data[4], ip_car_i/centre_1/data[5], ip_car_i/motor_1/key_state[4], ip_car_i/centre_1/key_state[4], ip_car_i/motor_1/key_state[5], ip_car_i/centre_1/key_state[5], ip_car_i/motor_1/key_state[7], ip_car_i/centre_1/key_state[7], ip_car_i/rf_r_1_rxdata[4], ip_car_i/rf_r_1_rxdata[5], ip_car_i/RF_r_1/rx[4], ip_car_i/RF_r_1/rx[5].
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
